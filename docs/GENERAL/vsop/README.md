Japan Airlines Virtual operates according to official **Bylaws** and a **Code of Conduct**, which govern member behavior and the structure of the virtual airline. These documents are reviewed and updated by the administration team as needed, with all major updates announced via Discord.

**Key Excerpts from the Code of Conduct and Bylaws:**

- _Code of Conduct_:  
  “In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, the administration team pledges to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.”

- _Code of Conduct_:  
  “Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the administration team at [Insert Email] or via Discord direct message.”

- _Bylaws_:  
  “Membership is open to any adult or minor above the age of 18 by either invitation or by application. Membership is fully voluntary. Membership is at the sole discretion of the Japan Virtual administration team. All members are expected to follow whatever posted rules, codes of conduct, and/or community guidelines are found on the JALV website, as well as on VATSIM, IVAO, and PilotEdge platforms.”

## Discord Community

Japan Airlines Virtual maintains a Discord server, which is the most important resource for keeping up to date with events, JALV news, and for engaging with our community.  
Membership in the Discord is not required, but **strongly encouraged**. The invite link can be found in the smartCars 3 App.

---

## Transfer Hours

JAL Virtual accepts **transfer hours** from previous virtual airline experience, up to a maximum of **15 hours**.  
A valid verification link must be provided at the time of application.

---

## Leave of Absence (LOA)

Pilots who cannot remain active for an extended period may file a **Leave of Absence (LOA)** with Human Resources.  
An LOA “freezes” your account, preventing removal for inactivity. To file an LOA, contact the Human Resources Manager.

---

## Suspension

Pilots who violate JAL Virtual policies may face disciplinary action.  
Depending on the severity, management reserves the right to **suspend** the pilot for a specified period.  
During suspension, access to all JAL Virtual systems and services will be restricted. Attempting to bypass restrictions may result in further consequences.

---

## Resignation

Pilots who wish to resign must notify the Human Resources Manager.  
If a pilot leaves on good terms (follows procedures and notifies us), their account will remain in our database should they wish to return.  
To return, simply notify the Human Resources Manager to have your account reactivated.

If you have any questions about these procedures or need further clarification, please contact the JAL Virtual administration team.
