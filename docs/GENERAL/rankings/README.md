**How Ranking Works**
- Your **Rank** is determined by your total logged hours (PIREP time).
- Higher ranks **unlock access to more aircraft types** and historic aircraft.
- Progression is automatic as you accumulate hours.

## 🛡️ Rank Progression Overview

- ⏳ **Hours are cumulative** and increase with each approved PIREP.
- 🚀 **Unlock new aircraft** as you move up the ranks.
- 🕰️ **Historic aircraft** (e.g., DC-3, MD-11, BN2P, B742-4, DC-6) are reserved for **Chief Pilots** and Senior Captains.
- 🏅 **Your rank displays on the roster and your pilot profile.**

## 📝 Example

> **If you have 180 hours**, you are a **Captain** and can fly all Captain-level aircraft and those below.
