# PIREP

## Requirements for Approval

To be approved, a PIREP must meet the following criteria:

- **Aircraft Booking:** You must book the **same type of aircraft** that you will fly.
- **Livery:** You must use an **appropriate livery** for the aircraft type.
- **Landing Rate:** Your landing rate must be **under -600 fpm** to receive log hours.
- **Fuel:** You must have taken off and landed with an appropriate fuel load for the flight, with **no fuel added after pushback or during flight**.
- **Flight Integrity:** You must **not** use slew mode after pushback or time acceleration at any time during the flight.
- **Route Compliance:** You must use an **appropriate route** for the flight and complete it in a reasonable amount of time, without extensive detours or obvious route deviations due to navigation errors or autopilot mismanagement.
- **Departure and Arrival:** You must **depart from and arrive at the booked origin and destination airports**.  
  *In-flight diversions are allowed with a valid reason.*
- **Good Airmanship:** Staff reserve the right to reject or invalidate PIREPs for any **departures from controlled flight or poor airmanship** not specifically listed above. Such cases are rare.
- **Simulator Crash:** If your simulator crashes with **over 75% of the flight completed**, you may file a PIREP, but must include a **secondary backup** of the tracked flight (e.g., Volanta).
- **Manual PIREPs:** If filing a manual PIREP, you **must include a link to a backup tracked flight** (e.g., Volanta, Elevetex, FsHub).
- **Aircraft and Livery:** The **correct type of aircraft and livery** must be used for the flight.

> #### **Tip:**  
> For the best chance of PIREP approval, always fly booked routes, use correct aircraft and liveries, avoid shortcuts, and keep a backup tracker running (such as Volanta or FsHub).
