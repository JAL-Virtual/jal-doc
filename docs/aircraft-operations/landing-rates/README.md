# Landing Rates

## üõ¨ Landing Rates Policy

:::info
**Landing rates are not a competition!**  
Smooth landings feel great, but chasing unrealistically low vertical speeds can be unsafe and is **not required** for approval.
:::

### üö¶ Approval Thresholds

- **Landings under -600 fpm:**  
  üü¢ **Accepted** (counts for your PIREP and hours)
- **Landings over -600 fpm:**  
  üî¥ **REJECTED** (PIREP will not be approved)

> **Target Range:**  
> Aim for a consistent landing rate between **-150** and **-300 fpm** for realism, safety, and passenger comfort.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Landing Rates

- **Fly a stabilized approach:** Maintain the correct speed, descent rate, and configuration all the way to touchdown.
- **Do not ‚Äúfloat‚Äù or force a greaser:**  
  Floating or dragging the approach for a soft touchdown increases runway overrun risk.
- **Land within the touchdown zone:** This is safer than aiming for a softer touchdown further down the runway.
- **Trust your training and SOPs:**  
  Fly the aircraft by the book; a ‚Äúgood‚Äù landing is a safe, on-speed, on-zone landing.
