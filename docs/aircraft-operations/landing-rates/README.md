## Landing Rates

It has become fashionable in the flight simulation community to pursue landing rates as low as possible. While a smooth landing is satisfying to pilots both real and virtual, it is not advantageous or safe to pursue a landing with a low vertical speed as the top priority.

To discourage this behavior, we have made our landing rate scorer binary â€“ your landing was safe if less than 600 fpm; anything over will cause your PIREP to be **REJECTED**.

We recommend you target a consistent landing rate between **-150** and **-300 fpm**.
