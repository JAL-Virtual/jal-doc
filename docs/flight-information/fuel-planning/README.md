# Fuel Planning

**Contingency Fuel** is planned at **3% of trip fuel or 15 minutes, whichever is higher.**

Flights to and from Europe include an additional **10 minutes of extra fuel**, automatically planned by the system to maintain a **15-minute longitudinal separation** between aircraft operating on the same airway and flight level.

Pilots must ensure that the calculated dispatch fuel is **sufficient to reach the destination** without relying on contingency fuel, alternate fuel, or final reserve fuel.

If **fuel on board (FOB)** drops below **Final Reserve Fuel (FINRES)**, pilots must declare a **fuel emergency** and divert to the nearest suitable aerodrome.

An **Air Safety Report (ASR)** must be submitted following any fuel emergency, including all relevant details of the event.
