# Simulation Settings

All flights must be conducted at **1x simulation speed**.

**Exception:**  
Following a game or WASM crash, pilots may reload from a saved state and use increased simulation rate **only to return to the original position/time**.

An **Air Safety Report (ASR)** with verifiable proof must be submitted in such cases.
